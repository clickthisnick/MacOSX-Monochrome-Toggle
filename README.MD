# Usage

Create Shortcuts based on the png in this folder

This used to be done with AppleScript but using Shortcuts is cleaner

# Information

I strongly believe that using screens in monochrome will lead to less incentive to continue using the screen. If you have ever been to a casino and played slots, it is a lot of fun to lose money when the machine flashes all sorts of colorful lights and vibrant sounds. I believe the bright pixels of a screen act in a somewhat similar fashion to keep you hooked to the screen.

There are a few different files in this repo and are explained below.

# Compatibility

This is known to work for OSX Sonoma. Other versions of OSX might need modifications to the Shortcut files.

# Files

## toggleOn.png

This will be setup on cron to run every minute so that you don't have grayscale turned off for long periods of time

## toggleOnOff.png

You can add this to the dock so you can toggle grayscale on and off if you need

## closeTabs.scpt

File to close Safari browser tabs

## gray.icns

This icon is a gray button which I think goes well with the functionality of the script.

Icon was found [here](https://iconarchive.com/show/soft-scraps-icons-by-hopstarter/Button-Blank-Gray-icon.html)

You can change the icon of the monochromeToggle.app by viewing the App in Finder, right clicking the App and choosing "Get Info". Then you can drag and icon over the small icon image in the top left of the Info screen.
